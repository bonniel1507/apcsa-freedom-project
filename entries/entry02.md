#### Context
We were currently working on one game on GDevelop, we get it to move and it will collect coins. The character will have to avoid colliding the slime or else, it will lose a life and restart the stage. But, if the character jumps on the slime, it will kill it. It's going well with scene 1, but we wanted the character to jump with the up button instead of the space bar. We were using one account for GDevelop, so there will be a little problem with saving it. So, we decided to either split up and work on different games or different scenes the same time.
