#### Content

We were currently working on one game on [GDevelop](https://gdevelop.io/), we get it to move and it will collect coins. The character will have to avoid colliding the slime or else, it will lose a life and restart the stage. But, if the character jumps on the slime, it will kill it. It's going well with scene 1, but we wanted the character to jump with the up button instead of the space bar. It's not 100% neccessary, but it would allow the player to play with one hand. Also, if there's more function we add on in the future that the player would need to play with the other hand. This [website](https://wiki.gdevelop.io/gdevelop5/tutorials/platformer/part-4) tells us how make the character jumps. Also, with how to make the player lose a life, we have the hearts, but need to make it disappear when the character collides with the slime. We were using one account for GDevelop, so there will be a little problem with saving seperatly. So, we decided to either split up and work on different games or different scenes the same time.

#### EDP and Skills

We are still on the stage of research the problem and Brainstorm possible solutions on the engineering design process. As we say, we were trying to find out how to make the character jump with the up button instead by default the space bar. We are still currently finding out ways to do it. We also wanted to create different mini games and because of this there would be numerous obstacles coming up. We start to plan others games when we got enough information.

Two skills developed was Collaboration and Problem decomposition. We have to be careful on how the make the character go as we each worked on little parts of the game. For how to make the character move and and triggers each funtions, we will have to break down of how it will happen, then what is the result of this action..
