#### Content

We were currently working on one game on GDevelop, we get it to move and it will collect coins. The character will have to avoid colliding the slime or else, it will lose a life and restart the stage. But, if the character jumps on the slime, it will kill it. It's going well with scene 1, but we wanted the character to jump with the up button instead of the space bar. It's not 100% neccessary, but it would allow the player to play with one hand. Also, if there's more function we add on in the future that the player would need to play with the other hand. Also, with how to make the player lose a life, we have the hearts, but need to make it disappear when the character collides with the slime. We were using one account for GDevelop, so there will be a little problem with saving seperatly. So, we decided to either split up and work on different games or different scenes the same time.

#### EDP and Skills

We are still on the stage of research the problem on the engineering design process. As we say, we were trying to find out how to make the character jump with the up button instead by default the space bar. We are still currently finding out ways to do it.
