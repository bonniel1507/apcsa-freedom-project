### Content
My mini game is like done and now it's just to get some feedback from our classmates. In class, we did a music chair, so there's someone who at least saw your project. Some feedbacks we got back were add instructions for each game before it starts. Other than make some edits, we also have to prepare a [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18SfQWYNKy7jik_4suVJHl-IVrZS0XAEGqawleiPXsUg/edit?usp=sharing_eil_m&ts=645bcb4f) explaining our process to the class. We chose number 4, so we don't go very early, but we went at like almost at the end because of missing people.

The expo was very chaotic, for me. We present our [game](https://gd.games/instant-builds/2fc6c59d-9a7b-4fda-9fd2-faac702910cb) to our visitors and we have a ranking board to put down their highest score. And because people have plenty of time, they just stayed there and play for a long time. I wasn't really nervous because I have my teammates with me. If we saw someone misses some explaining about their parts, we will add on for them.

### EDP and Skills
The stage of engineering design process we completed are Improve as needed and Communicate the results. We made necessary changes to our game and talked about it with our teammates. The two skills developed were Consideration and Debugging. We got many feedbacks, but we have to choose which ones to add to our game for better experience. Since, we added more features, some errors came with it, we would have to fix the errors.
