# Entry 6
##### 05/25/23

My mini game is like done and now it's just to get some feedback from our classmates. In class, we did a music chair, so there's someone who at least saw your project. Some feedbacks we got back were add instructions for each game before it starts. Other than make some edits, we also have to prepare a [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18SfQWYNKy7jik_4suVJHl-IVrZS0XAEGqawleiPXsUg/edit?usp=sharing_eil_m&ts=645bcb4f) explaining our process to the class. We chose number 4, so we don't go very early, but we went at like almost at the end because of missing people.

The expo was very chaotic, for me.
