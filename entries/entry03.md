### Content

Me and my teammates had decided ro work separately on the mini games because there will be conflicts when saving if we worked on the same game but different computers. So, my mini game idea was matching the cards. The user will click on the card, it will flip and find a pair. I first imagined the game is on a table, so I used a background that's like a table and poker cards on top.

The poker cards were all be facing down and it serves like a placeholder and then when the game start it will shuffle.
