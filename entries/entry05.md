### Context

It's getting close to the day which we turn in like a draft of the project. It first had to work and meets our goal.

What I have left to do is a border, which when the bird bumps onto the pipe or fly too high or too low, it will die. Also added a score on the top left for the players to see.

The first line in the add condition is like a if statement with a or inside. So, when the bird hits the pipes or border, the scene will restart. Border is a line that I placed at the top and bottom, outside of the screen, so when the game runs the player won't see them. It's to make sure that the bird doesn't go off screen and use as a loop hole to get more points.

The score is just a text that's shown on the screen, so when have to set it as a variable in the line of add action.
