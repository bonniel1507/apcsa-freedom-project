### Content
The tool I've decided for my freedom project is [GDevelop](https://gdevelop.io/). It was for making a game. At first I was thinking of making something to help me pass a game, but the tinkering didn't went well, so I just thought of making a game instead. I'll be working with Yuki and Grace. We decided to make a game with levels and they get more difficult as you go up.

### EDP and Skills
Right now on the stage of engineering design process is defining the problem and research the problem. Our question is what type of games to make. We were thinking of creating multiple mini games. We may or may not use all the ideas we put together in a google doc, but we will keep on exploring for more options. We can see what games others had made and brainstrom for ourselves. Two skills developed was communication and creativity. Talking to my partners on deciding the tool and ideas of the game and we have to think of a game that's different than the other games on the platform.
